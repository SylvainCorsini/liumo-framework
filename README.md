# Liumo Framework
A very minimalist framework by Sylvain Corsini.

It's based on some Symfony components (see composer.json).

There is three folders:
 - Public: which can contains css, js, imgs... It's the target of the server...
 - App: which contains the MVC structure, you can edit and add files. (Only Controller and Model works at this moment)
 - Src: which contains conf et primary skeleton of the framework:
    - Core: primary files.

# Next update
- TemplateBuilder
- QueryBuilder
